## Deploy

This instance uses Docker Compose to deploy the application with Traefik as a proxy.

You need to build and tag the image:

1. Ensure you have the ENV value DECIDIM_ENV=staging or DECIDIM_ENV=production
2. Run
   ```
   ./build.sh
   ```
3. Deploy
  ```
  docker compose up -d
  ```

## Backups

Database is backup every day using https://github.com/tiredofit/docker-db-backup (see docker-compose.yml for details)

## Setting up the application

You will need to do some steps before having the app working properly once you've deployed it:

1. Open a Rails console in the server: `bundle exec rails console`
2. Create a System Admin user:

```ruby
user = Decidim::System::Admin.new(email: <email>, password: <password>, password_confirmation: <password>)
user.save!
```

3. Visit `<your app url>/system` and login with your system admin credentials
4. Create a new organization. Check the locales you want to use for that organization, and select a default locale.
5. Set the correct default host for the organization, otherwise the app will not work properly. Note that you need to include any subdomain you might be using.
6. Fill the rest of the form and submit it.

You're good to go!
